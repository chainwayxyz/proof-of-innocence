        Tornado Cash is a popular protocol on Ethereum that allows users to make
        private transactions by breaking the on-chain link between the recipient
        and destination addresses. However, there may be instances where a user
        wants to demonstrate that their use of Tornado Cash is above board and
        not related to any illicit activity. Thatâ€™s where Proof of Innocence
        comes in. Proof of Innocence is a tool that allows users to prove that
        their withdrawals from Tornado Cash are not from a list of specified
        deposits, selected by the user themselves. This allows users to clear
        their name and demonstrate their innocence without revealing their
        identity.

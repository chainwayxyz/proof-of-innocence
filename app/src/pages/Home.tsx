    <p>Tornado Cash is a popular protocol on Ethereum that allows users to make private transactions by breaking the on-chain link between the recipient and destination addresses. However, there may be instances where a user wants to demonstrate that their use of Tornado Cash is above board and not related to any illicit activity. Thatâ€™s where Proof of Innocence comes in. Proof of Innocence is a tool that allows users to prove that their withdrawals from Tornado Cash are not from a list of specified deposits, selected by the user themselves. This allows users to clear their name and demonstrate their innocence without revealing their identity.</p>
